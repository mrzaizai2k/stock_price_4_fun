## Database

1. User database:

   The chatbot utilizes a user database stored in `./memory`. When a new user executes the `/watchlist` command, the chatbot automatically checks if the user is in the database. The database contains the following information:

   - user_id: Unique identifier for users.
   - watch_list: List of stocks associated with each user.
   - step: User's progress step in the chatbot's functionality.

   This user database is a crucial component, enabling seamless interactions and personalized experiences for users. The database is actively used in various functions throughout the bot.

2. Scrape data trading: 
   
   The chatbot employs Selenium to scrape trading data from FTPS. The scraped data provides insights into buy/sell periods and facilitates analysis of win/loss trading patterns. The code for this functionality is available in src/trading_record.py. This feature enhances the chatbot's capability to provide valuable trading analytics. The code can be found in `src/trading_record.py`


## Open VScode tunnel 

As to this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels#:~:text=In%20the%20VS%20Code%20Account,prompted%20to%20log%20into%20GitHub), you need to first set up the tunnel in your code

      curl -Lk 'https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=cli-alpine-x64' --output vscode_cli.tar.gz

      tar -xf vscode_cli.tar.gz

Then use this command in CLI

      ./code tunnel

Or in the `src/stock_bot.py`

      result = subprocess.run(command, check=True, text=True)

Whenever you want to run your bot remotely, but got this issue: "make sure that only one bot instance is running". Please kill bot first

      make kill
      make bot

## Summarize Sound

The bot is in development to summarize all sounds from audio or voice
.It can recognize sounds with various formats such as `.mp3, .wav,.ogg,.m4a` with [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) 

To setup Whisper 

      pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 
      # on Ubuntu or Debian
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

Then I use Google Translate API to translate the text to English. All the code can be found `src/summarize_text.py`

I am trying some summarize model but has some withdraws (the model is too big, or too dump)

The bot can also transform your text into to-do list. you can click to toggle the checklist 

## Summarize News
The bot can also summarize news for stocks in your watch list. The news database is stored in `data/summary_stock_news.json`. I will update the database to MongoDB
